<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>
<p>
    Here you can manage your identities.
    These can be used to authenticate yourself against gemini servers,
    should they want to authenticate you.<br />
    How many identities you create is up to you.
    You can have just one you use for all services,
    or you can create a distinct identity for every individual service.

            Optional password to encrypt the identity.
            If supplied, the identity is encrypted and can only be used with the password.<br />
            It's impossible to get the identity back if you lose the password.

        <i>
            The expiration date is part of the identity system and as such is a required field.<br />
            As computers get stronger, they become better at breaking cryptography.<br />
            It's best practice to replace your identities every few years.
